The service will provide supported living services to residents with high support needs. 

The two contracts have been awarded for the following terms and contract values:

The following information is applicable to all lots: ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.
Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.
An eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.

LOT ONE-Nottinghamshire County Council (NCC) is looking to, to purchase four single deck electric buses, along with associated tethered plug-in vehicle charging equipment. These zero emission vehicles are to be used on NCC's bus services.These routes will form part of NCC's supported bus service network and will initially be operated by NCC. The routes will be operated in a suburban environment in the Rushcliffe and Mansfield areas of Nottinghamshire. Each vehicle covers between 191 miles/307 kilometres and 224 miles/360 kilometres per day including dead mileage, the Peak Vehicle Rate (PVR) is four vehicles.
Tenders are invited for the supply of vehicles and equipment, from a single source of supply, in respect of operating the bus services detailed within this document, using electric, low floor accessible buses, along with associated tethered plug-in charging equipment. Each vehicle must be certified as an Ultra-Low Emissions Bus at point of delivery.
Full specifications of Nottinghamshire County Councils requirements are included in the invitation to tender documents.
The budget for the vehicles and charging equipment described in Lot 1 is £1.452 million (excluding VAT). Bids that are over this value will be regarded as non-compliant and will not be evaluated.Full details of this procurement are included in the invitation to tender documents, re DN 431291. LOT 2 Leicester City Council (LCC) is seeking to purchase five single-deck single entrance fully electric buses for operation on the Birstall Park and Ride 303 route. Route details and timetable can be found in Part 3B of the tender documents.
This service currently has a peak vehicle requirement of 3 buses and one operational branded spare. Each bus has a weekday mileage of around 140 miles. There are aspirations to increase frequency in the near future, which would increase the PVR to 4 buses.
All buses will have a length of up to 12.5 metres and capacity for at least 58 persons and a minimum 35 seats and one wheelchair space.
LCC will ideally be looking for a solution which provides the maximum operating distance on a single overnight charge (less than 6 hours) from a dedicated charging depot at Birstall Park and Ride site. As well as avoiding the requirement for any in-service charging, this allows flexible use of the vehicles on other services should this be required.
LCC has a fixed funding limit of £1,800,000 excluding VAT for these vehicles which is subject to the buses coming into operation by January 2021.

The AD plant will need to have valid and appropriate planning permission, environmental and other relevant permits for quantity of food waste to be handled and otherwise all permissions and certification required to deliver the services for the duration of the Contract Period. The food waste collected by the Waste Collection Authorities in Kent will be transferred at and hauled from 7 different Waste Transfer Stations (WTSs) throughout Kent. The third-party waste transfer suppliers that provide waste transfer services in Kent on behalf of KCC will deliver food waste to the AD plant at KCC's own cost. This cost will be included when considering tenders for food waste processing services. KCC will provide a matrix to allow bidders to calculate the cost of haulage for inclusion.  It is anticipated that the AD plant will need to have the capacity and capability to handle up to 24 000 tonnes of food waste per annum from 1.4.2020, up to 37 000 tonnes from 16.1.2021, and up to 45 000 tonnes from 2023 (this will be confirmed in the ITT). A detailed specification for these services is currently under development. The requirements are likely to include the following requirements (full details which may differ to be confirmed in the ITT): • for the AD plant to receive food waste Monday - Saturday, including Public and Bank Holidays in England & Wales (the only exception being Christmas Day, Boxing Day, and New Years Day unless otherwise agreed by KCC); • for the AD plant to receive food waste delivered by articulated vehicles (no tipping trailers; c. net weight 28 tonnes) and bulk haulage vehicles with de-mountable container loading systems (Ro-Ro), tipping discharge mechanism, or non-tipping articulated; • for the AD plant to receive food waste delivered by Refuse Compaction Vehicles (RCVs) and split-bodied RCVs with side pods used to collect food waste from the kerbside where RCVs are able to direct deliver to the AD plant; and • for the AD plant to receive and process food waste collected in both biodegradable and non-biodegradable liners and food waste that may be wrapped in newspaper, kitchen roll or plastic bags; these items should not be considered as 'contamination'. Bidders will be required to pass pass/fail selection criteria regarding their organisation's economic and financial standing, insurance, environmental management, health and safety, and technical and professional ability (including meeting technical minimum requirements), as well as the standard exclusion grounds.

KCC will set Minimum Quality Threshold (MQT) for the 'quality' element of the Tender. The Bidder whose Tender meets the MQT, and who submits Contract Prices that result in the Lowest 'Notional Tender Value' (NTV), will be the bidder with the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) and be ranked first and will become the KCC's Preferred Supplier. KCC will reserve the right to exclude bidders from the procurement process that fail to score the MQT for quality. The 'Notional Tender Value' (NTV), which will be used to evaluate tenders, will be calculated based on the total notional cost of the service to KCC and will include: • the Bidder's proposed Gate Fee per Tonne of food waste accepted at the AD plant multiplied by indicative tonnages (i.e. based on the Gate Fee submitted as part the Tender); and • the Cost per Tonne per Mile for the haulage of food waste to the AD plant by third-party suppliers - KCC will have the food waste hauled to the AD plant by its third-party waste transfer suppliers at its own cost. This cost will be included when considering tenders for food waste processing services. A matrix showing the location of the WTSs from which food waste will be hauled together with notional tonnages from each WTS and a rate per tonne/mile will be included within the tender documents. Bidders will calculate the cost to the authority of haulage using the matrix provided. For the avoidance of doubt, haulage will not form part of the required services. The total haulage cost will be added to each bidder's total Gate Fee costs together forming the Notional Tender Value (NTV). This NTV will be used in the evaluation of tenders.  Details regarding sub-award criteria will be set out in the ITT documentation, including: • how quality sub-criteria will be scored and weighted; • what the Minimum Quality Threshold will be; and • how the NTV will be calculated (e.g. cost assumptions).

The framework agreement will be let for an initial period of three years with an option to extend for a further year. This will be a framework agreement with individual call-off contracts between the contractor and schools.

Initially the framework will cover 11 primary schools in Bracknell Forest with a combined roll number of around 3,800 pupils. Total meals sales in the school year 2017/18 were 332,000 and all sites have full production kitchens.

The framework agreement will be open for other Berkshire schools to join later should they wish to at any subsequent point of the framework's duration.

Main features of the new framework:
•	Meals will meet the School Food Regulations for school lunches and the Caroline Walker guidelines for portion sizes. 
•	Meals will be made using fresh ingredients and prepared on the day.
•	Low sugar and low-fat levels alternatives used 
•	Free of artificial colours and additives wherever possible.
•	Vegetarian options to be imaginative and offer variety.
•	Fresh and seasonal produce to be used in menus.
•	Local sourcing of foods if possible. 

Applicants should be aware that all staff working in schools will require DBS (enhanced level) checks and the staff will be required to give their written permission for such checks to be performed.

The total estimated framework value ranges between £2,000,000 (2 million GBP) and £6,000,000 (6 million GBP) depending on framework and call-off contract lengths and take up by other Berkshire schools.

This programme aims to innovate around the use of smart metering to design, test, manufacture and trial EV chargepoint devices that can perform smart charging in a context beyond the existing smart meter roll out scope. The target contexts for these devices are on-street charging outside the home, and workplace charging. Other contexts will be considered, so long as they are outside the existing smart meter roll out scope which comprises home and microbusiness off-street contexts.  
The programme's aim is to demonstrate that the smart metering system provides a holistic and long-term solution for electric vehicle smart charging, one which can deliver in a range of charging contexts. 

Background
This programme contributes to policy objectives set out in the Government's EV Smart Charging consultation , which outlines the Government's approach and objectives for smart charging of EVs and, seeks evidence on a charging solution. 
The long-term EV smart charging solution needs to meet four policy objectives: grid protection (including cyber security), consumer protection (including interoperability and data privacy), innovation and consumer uptake (of both EVs and smart chargepoints). 
The smart meter system was proposed by the Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) as the lead option for non-public EV smart charging, based on its established ability to deliver load control in a way which minimises risks to consumers and the wider electricity system. 
Smart metering's current scope extends only to domestic and microbusinesses however, while a long-term solution for smart charging must deliver in a broader range of settings, including public smart charging.  This programme aims to show that smart metering can perform smart charging in a range of contexts outside the current scope. 

Outputs of the programme will include:

Phase 1 Development 
•	Design of a charge point which can operate in the relevant contexts (to be chosen by the service provider) and interface with the smart metering system, acting on load control messages sent via this system. 
•	Manufacture of the device at test scale (10). 
•	Successful testing and issue resolution - demonstration that the device, in simulation conditions, can operate smart EV chargepoints in contexts other than domestic and microbusiness. 

Phase 2 Trial 
•	Trial of the device in the chosen relevant context(s) at scale of ~100 devices.

This Invitation to Tender has been prepared as part of meeting Herefordshire County Council's legal duties to make arrangements for the involvement of people in the commissioning, provision and scrutiny of health and social care services. It details a service requirement for a local Healthwatch organisation, known as ""Healthwatch Herefordshire,"" and the subsequent discharge of its statutory duties.
Healthwatch is an independent consumer champion for both health and social care. It exists locally as Healthwatch Herefordshire and nationally as Healthwatch England. The role of Healthwatch Herefordshire is to give both citizens and local communities a stronger voice to influence and challenge how health and social care services are commissioned and provided. As well as championing the collective voice, Healthwatch Herefordshire also signposts people to information, advice and independent advocacy to help them make choices about health and care services and, if necessary, signpost to appropriate complaint administrators.
Healthwatch Herefordshire works locally as well as with the national Healthwatch England.
The successful tenderer will be expected to operate from a local office within the county and will be expected to

These are children who are not receiving support currently from statutory agencies; and are at risk of harm and/or experiencing adverse impact to their health and wellbeing due to Covid-19.

The contract will focus on supporting children experiencing or at risk of hidden harm. These are vulnerable children who do not meet the threshold for statutory services and do not have an education, health and care plan or child in need or child protection plan and who are not looked after. These children and young people are being adversely impacted by lockdown.

The purpose of the contract is to prevent their needs escalating so that they do not require more significant interventions either now or at a later date. The group of children that will be identified include those who have experienced or are at risk of serious crimes, young people with disabilities and SEND, children in families experiencing domestic abuse and young couples perpetrating domestic abuse, children experiencing mental health difficulties, trafficked children and homeless families and young people.

As a result of Covid-19 measures, there is a specific need to provide additional services to children who either are, or at risk of, experiencing harm because many of the usual mechanisms for identifying risks have been removed or are experiencing other pressures, for example health visitors, police, community hubs, GPs and schools.

In this instance the events that have led to the extreme urgency are the lockdown which has been a key measure in trying to contain Covid-19 and in conjunction with that the closure of schools, to all but a specified minority of children. Whilst that minority has included 'vulnerable children' (as defined in the DfE Guidance: Supporting Vulnerable Children and Young People During the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak - actions for educational providers and other partners, updated 15 Mai 2020) not all such children have been in attendance and some children who would not have met the definition of 'vulnerable' at the commencement of the lockdown will have become 'vulnerable' during the lockdown period.",,,"Any region","85300000 ",,beth.lord@education.gov.uk,"St. Paul&apos;s Place",,Sheffield,"S1 2JF",England,,,,,,01/06/2020,31/10/2020,31/05/2020,NO,,No,Yes,No,Services,7265000,,01/06/2020,7265000,"[Barnardo's|Tanners House, Barkingside, Ilford, Essex, IG6 1QG|NONE_OTHER||No|Yes]",,01/06/2020,31/10/2020,"NegotiatedProcedureWithoutPriorPublicationOJEU ",,11:59

The Commissioner is responsible for the direct contracting of support for children and young people eligible for health funding to support assessed health and eligible social care need. 

To enable children and young people to receive person centered care whilst living at home the Commissioner has a need to commission Providers to deliver high quality personal care to support the child, family and carers.
 
These children and young people with complex health care needs require a registered nurse to undertake a clinical lead role and provide clinical oversight and management of the package of support, with the care delivered by highly competent non-registered health care staff, but may require the direct provision of registered nursing staff to deliver care.
 
Caring for children with complex needs in a community setting is an area of specialised work focused on the services and professionals that offer nursing support and interventions to children who have very different physiological and psychological needs to adults.
