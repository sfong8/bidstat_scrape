The initial phases of the Manydown project have been allocated for at least 3,200 (with potential for this to be increased by 10% up to 3,250) private and affordable dwellings in the first phase with the potential to develop a further 4,600 dwellings in future phases, subject to satisfactory performance during phase1, community accommodation together with associated infrastructure and commercial/retail space. Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council and Hampshire County Council ('the councils'), acting as joint land owners, wish to deliver the project in conjunction with a partner through a joint venture arrangement. The partner, or consortium of partners, will bring expertise, creativity and financial resources to the development.

The purpose of this opportunity is to find a joint venture partner to enter into a 50/50 joint venture vehicle ('JV'). The selected JV partner will have the financial capability, technical resource and experience to deliver a new neighbourhood of the highest quality. The councils' aim is to incentivise its JV partner to take a long-term approach with strong placemaking at the heart of the delivery strategy. This approach will deliver a high quality new community, whilst also creating value and financial returns. It is envisaged that the councils will participate in the JV through a corporate special purpose vehicle (councils' SPV') . The councils intend to contribute certain land interests to the JV (subject to satisfaction of certain conditions).

The following information is applicable to all lots: ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.
Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.
An eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.

This service forms part of the mental health supported accommodation pathway. The pathway supports adults with severe mental illness (SMI) who are unable to live independently. The pathway accommodates residents who have lost their tenancies or are unable to live in their own home without support due to the lack of daily living skills. The pathway often bridges the gap between a long stay in hospital and independent living. The mental health supported accommodation pathway fosters Camden's ambitions to make Camden a place ""...where everyone can lead happy, healthy and fulfilling lives"", and where ""no one should experience discrimination or be made to feel ashamed or isolated because of a mental health problem"". This service was previously tendered as two of four Lots in August 2019. See OJEU notice 382931-2019. This service was procured using the light touch regime of the public contracts regulations 2015. The approach used was a one-stage approach similar to an open procedure. Only those providers that demonstrated suitable expertise and experience as part of the selection stage were evaluated against the award criteria.

LOT ONE-Nottinghamshire County Council (NCC) is looking to, to purchase four single deck electric buses, along with associated tethered plug-in vehicle charging equipment. These zero emission vehicles are to be used on NCC's bus services.These routes will form part of NCC's supported bus service network and will initially be operated by NCC. The routes will be operated in a suburban environment in the Rushcliffe and Mansfield areas of Nottinghamshire. Each vehicle covers between 191 miles/307 kilometres and 224 miles/360 kilometres per day including dead mileage, the Peak Vehicle Rate (PVR) is four vehicles.
Tenders are invited for the supply of vehicles and equipment, from a single source of supply, in respect of operating the bus services detailed within this document, using electric, low floor accessible buses, along with associated tethered plug-in charging equipment. Each vehicle must be certified as an Ultra-Low Emissions Bus at point of delivery.
Full specifications of Nottinghamshire County Councils requirements are included in the invitation to tender documents.
The budget for the vehicles and charging equipment described in Lot 1 is £1.452 million (excluding VAT). Bids that are over this value will be regarded as non-compliant and will not be evaluated.Full details of this procurement are included in the invitation to tender documents, re DN 431291. LOT 2 Leicester City Council (LCC) is seeking to purchase five single-deck single entrance fully electric buses for operation on the Birstall Park and Ride 303 route. Route details and timetable can be found in Part 3B of the tender documents.
This service currently has a peak vehicle requirement of 3 buses and one operational branded spare. Each bus has a weekday mileage of around 140 miles. There are aspirations to increase frequency in the near future, which would increase the PVR to 4 buses.
All buses will have a length of up to 12.5 metres and capacity for at least 58 persons and a minimum 35 seats and one wheelchair space.
LCC will ideally be looking for a solution which provides the maximum operating distance on a single overnight charge (less than 6 hours) from a dedicated charging depot at Birstall Park and Ride site. As well as avoiding the requirement for any in-service charging, this allows flexible use of the vehicles on other services should this be required.
LCC has a fixed funding limit of £1,800,000 excluding VAT for these vehicles which is subject to the buses coming into operation by January 2021.

The AD plant will need to have valid and appropriate planning permission, environmental and other relevant permits for quantity of food waste to be handled and otherwise all permissions and certification required to deliver the services for the duration of the Contract Period. The food waste collected by the Waste Collection Authorities in Kent will be transferred at and hauled from 7 different Waste Transfer Stations (WTSs) throughout Kent. The third-party waste transfer suppliers that provide waste transfer services in Kent on behalf of KCC will deliver food waste to the AD plant at KCC's own cost. This cost will be included when considering tenders for food waste processing services. KCC will provide a matrix to allow bidders to calculate the cost of haulage for inclusion.  It is anticipated that the AD plant will need to have the capacity and capability to handle up to 24 000 tonnes of food waste per annum from 1.4.2020, up to 37 000 tonnes from 16.1.2021, and up to 45 000 tonnes from 2023 (this will be confirmed in the ITT). A detailed specification for these services is currently under development. The requirements are likely to include the following requirements (full details which may differ to be confirmed in the ITT): • for the AD plant to receive food waste Monday - Saturday, including Public and Bank Holidays in England & Wales (the only exception being Christmas Day, Boxing Day, and New Years Day unless otherwise agreed by KCC); • for the AD plant to receive food waste delivered by articulated vehicles (no tipping trailers; c. net weight 28 tonnes) and bulk haulage vehicles with de-mountable container loading systems (Ro-Ro), tipping discharge mechanism, or non-tipping articulated; • for the AD plant to receive food waste delivered by Refuse Compaction Vehicles (RCVs) and split-bodied RCVs with side pods used to collect food waste from the kerbside where RCVs are able to direct deliver to the AD plant; and • for the AD plant to receive and process food waste collected in both biodegradable and non-biodegradable liners and food waste that may be wrapped in newspaper, kitchen roll or plastic bags; these items should not be considered as 'contamination'. Bidders will be required to pass pass/fail selection criteria regarding their organisation's economic and financial standing, insurance, environmental management, health and safety, and technical and professional ability (including meeting technical minimum requirements), as well as the standard exclusion grounds.

KCC will set Minimum Quality Threshold (MQT) for the 'quality' element of the Tender. The Bidder whose Tender meets the MQT, and who submits Contract Prices that result in the Lowest 'Notional Tender Value' (NTV), will be the bidder with the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) and be ranked first and will become the KCC's Preferred Supplier. KCC will reserve the right to exclude bidders from the procurement process that fail to score the MQT for quality. The 'Notional Tender Value' (NTV), which will be used to evaluate tenders, will be calculated based on the total notional cost of the service to KCC and will include: • the Bidder's proposed Gate Fee per Tonne of food waste accepted at the AD plant multiplied by indicative tonnages (i.e. based on the Gate Fee submitted as part the Tender); and • the Cost per Tonne per Mile for the haulage of food waste to the AD plant by third-party suppliers - KCC will have the food waste hauled to the AD plant by its third-party waste transfer suppliers at its own cost. This cost will be included when considering tenders for food waste processing services. A matrix showing the location of the WTSs from which food waste will be hauled together with notional tonnages from each WTS and a rate per tonne/mile will be included within the tender documents. Bidders will calculate the cost to the authority of haulage using the matrix provided. For the avoidance of doubt, haulage will not form part of the required services. The total haulage cost will be added to each bidder's total Gate Fee costs together forming the Notional Tender Value (NTV). This NTV will be used in the evaluation of tenders.  Details regarding sub-award criteria will be set out in the ITT documentation, including: • how quality sub-criteria will be scored and weighted; • what the Minimum Quality Threshold will be; and • how the NTV will be calculated (e.g. cost assumptions).

Main features of the new framework:
•	Meals will meet the School Food Regulations for school lunches and the Caroline Walker guidelines for portion sizes. 
•	Meals will be made using fresh ingredients and prepared on the day.
•	Low sugar and low-fat levels alternatives used 
•	Free of artificial colours and additives wherever possible.

•	Fresh and seasonal produce to be used in menus.
•	Local sourcing of foods if possible. 

Applicants should be aware that all staff working in schools will require DBS (enhanced level) checks and the staff will be required to give their written permission for such checks to be performed.

The total estimated framework value ranges between £2,000,000 (2 million GBP) and £6,000,000 (6 million GBP) depending on framework and call-off contract lengths and take up by other Berkshire schools.

This programme aims to innovate around the use of smart metering to design, test, manufacture and trial EV chargepoint devices that can perform smart charging in a context beyond the existing smart meter roll out scope. The target contexts for these devices are on-street charging outside the home, and workplace charging. Other contexts will be considered, so long as they are outside the existing smart meter roll out scope which comprises home and microbusiness off-street contexts.  
The programme's aim is to demonstrate that the smart metering system provides a holistic and long-term solution for electric vehicle smart charging, one which can deliver in a range of charging contexts. 

Background
This programme contributes to policy objectives set out in the Government's EV Smart Charging consultation , which outlines the Government's approach and objectives for smart charging of EVs and, seeks evidence on a charging solution. 
The long-term EV smart charging solution needs to meet four policy objectives: grid protection (including cyber security), consumer protection (including interoperability and data privacy), innovation and consumer uptake (of both EVs and smart chargepoints). 
The smart meter system was proposed by the Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) as the lead option for non-public EV smart charging, based on its established ability to deliver load control in a way which minimises risks to consumers and the wider electricity system. 
Smart metering's current scope extends only to domestic and microbusinesses however, while a long-term solution for smart charging must deliver in a broader range of settings, including public smart charging.  This programme aims to show that smart metering can perform smart charging in a range of contexts outside the current scope. 

Outputs of the programme will include:

Phase 1 Development 
•	Design of a charge point which can operate in the relevant contexts (to be chosen by the service provider) and interface with the smart metering system, acting on load control messages sent via this system. 
•	Manufacture of the device at test scale (10). 
•	Successful testing and issue resolution - demonstration that the device, in simulation conditions, can operate smart EV chargepoints in contexts other than domestic and microbusiness. 

Phase 2 Trial 
•	Trial of the device in the chosen relevant context(s) at scale of ~100 devices.

This Invitation to Tender has been prepared as part of meeting Herefordshire County Council's legal duties to make arrangements for the involvement of people in the commissioning, provision and scrutiny of health and social care services. It details a service requirement for a local Healthwatch organisation, known as ""Healthwatch Herefordshire,"" and the subsequent discharge of its statutory duties.
Healthwatch is an independent consumer champion for both health and social care. It exists locally as Healthwatch Herefordshire and nationally as Healthwatch England. The role of Healthwatch Herefordshire is to give both citizens and local communities a stronger voice to influence and challenge how health and social care services are commissioned and provided. As well as championing the collective voice, Healthwatch Herefordshire also signposts people to information, advice and independent advocacy to help them make choices about health and care services and, if necessary, signpost to appropriate complaint administrators.
Healthwatch Herefordshire works locally as well as with the national Healthwatch England.
The successful tenderer will be expected to operate from a local office within the county and will be expected to
source and fund this office themselves.
This tender is let under the ""light touch"" arrangements of the Public Contracts Regulations (PCR 2015)

These are children who are not receiving support currently from statutory agencies; and are at risk of harm and/or experiencing adverse impact to their health and wellbeing due to Covid-19.

The contract will focus on supporting children experiencing or at risk of hidden harm. These are vulnerable children who do not meet the threshold for statutory services and do not have an education, health and care plan or child in need or child protection plan and who are not looked after. These children and young people are being adversely impacted by lockdown.

The purpose of the contract is to prevent their needs escalating so that they do not require more significant interventions either now or at a later date. The group of children that will be identified include those who have experienced or are at risk of serious crimes, young people with disabilities and SEND, children in families experiencing domestic abuse and young couples perpetrating domestic abuse, children experiencing mental health difficulties, trafficked children and homeless families and young people.

As a result of Covid-19 measures, there is a specific need to provide additional services to children who either are, or at risk of, experiencing harm because many of the usual mechanisms for identifying risks have been removed or are experiencing other pressures, for example health visitors, police, community hubs, GPs and schools.

In this instance the events that have led to the extreme urgency are the lockdown which has been a key measure in trying to contain Covid-19 and in conjunction with that the closure of schools, to all but a specified minority of children. Whilst that minority has included 'vulnerable children' (as defined in the DfE Guidance: Supporting Vulnerable Children and Young People During the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak - actions for educational providers and other partners, updated 15 Mai 2020) not all such children have been in attendance and some children who would not have met the definition of 'vulnerable' at the commencement of the lockdown will have become 'vulnerable' during the lockdown period.",,,"Any region","85300000 ",,beth.lord@education.gov.uk,"St. Paul&apos;s Place",,Sheffield,"S1 2JF",England,,,,,,01/06/2020,31/10/2020,31/05/2020,NO,,No,Yes,No,Services,7265000,,01/06/2020,7265000,"[Barnardo's|Tanners House, Barkingside, Ilford, Essex, IG6 1QG|NONE_OTHER||No|Yes]",,01/06/2020,31/10/2020,"NegotiatedProcedureWithoutPriorPublicationOJEU ",,11:59

Caring for children with complex needs in a community setting is an area of specialised work focused on the services and professionals that offer nursing support and interventions to children who have very different physiological and psychological needs to adults.

This provision will be split into the three lots:

- Lot 1 Eastern Devon
- Lot 2 Northern Devon 
- Lot 3 Western Devon 

The impact of venous leg ulcers in adults can be significant. Venous leg ulcers can lead to social isolation, depression and loss of independence. Most people with venous leg ulcers experience pain that can be debilitating, leading to a loss of mobility and sleeplessness. 

Venous leg ulcers cost the NHS over one billion pounds per year. There are in excess of 100,000 active venous ulcers in the UK at any one time, and 80% of these have treatment that is based in the community.  

A venous leg ulcer is not a diagnosis; it is a manifestation of an underlying disease process and, as such, we need to see the person with the leg ulcer  first and foremost and the disease in that context. 

The definition of a venous leg ulcer (detailed in Appendix 1) would be an area of epidermal discontinuity lasting in excess of four weeks.  70-80% of leg ulcers are venous. 10-20% are of mixed venous/arterial. 10% are arterial and a small number are related to other causes . Due to the nature of the pathology the mixed and arterial leg ulcers would be referred on to specialist services eg vascular eg Tissue Viability for the most appropriate treatment. 

Venous leg ulcers affect around 1 in 500 people in the UK.  This rate rises sharply with age with an estimated 1 in 50 people over the age of 80 developing venous leg ulcers .  Chronic Venous leg ulceration has an estimated prevalence of between 0.1% and 0.3% in the UK.

In the UK, it is estimated that 1% of the population (and 3.6% of people older than 65) will suffer from leg ulceration during their life.

"Ventilator Challenge: Provision of Rapid Manufacture Ventilator Systems (RMVS) Second Contract Award",Contract,"Crown Commercial Service",Awarded,2020-08-27T08:37:56Z,"Ventilator Challenge: Provision of Rapid Manufacture Ventilator Systems (RMVS) Second Contract Award Notice","The 'Ventilator Challenge' was created by the UK government and delivered across several government departments (Department of Health and Social Care, Cabinet Office and Ministry of Defence) as part of the drive to increase ventilator supply and support the UK National Health Service (NHS) in its response to the Coronavirus disease global pandemic (COVID-19).

In March, the Prime Minister called on manufacturers to help the UK to step up production of ventilators to support the UK's response to the virus and save lives. This included working on new or adapted ventilator designs, as well the Government's work to buy ventilators from abroad.
The 'Rapid Manufacture Ventilator Systems (RMVS) programme' is a work stream within the Ventilator Challenge progressing novel and modified designs for ventilator devices, manufactured on a rapid basis to ensure sufficient capacity within the NHS.

Cabinet Office, who are running the RMVS programme on behalf of the UK government, engaged with a wide range of suppliers, including designers, manufacturers and component suppliers, to progress a number of ventilator models (by taking forward existing designs through licencing agreements and by developing new products based on existing products and based on new original designs) resulting in the manufacturer of over 14,000 ventilators to meet the identified need.

A Contract Award Notice was published on 25/05/2020 (reference 2020/S 100-243206) covering contracts awarded pursuant to the RMVS programme. This is a second Contract Award Notice that covers contracts awarded thereafter. This notice also updates the expenditure incurred for contracts relating to Team Consulting, TTP and Cambridge Consultants that were notified in the previous Contract Award Notice. These contracts were awarded on a time and materials basis and therefore additional expenditure was incurred since publication of the previous notice.

For the Smiths Parapac 300, the original contract value was £34,007,542.00. The contract was awarded for 4,418 ventilators, however these volumes were not achieved in the time frames given, therefore the spend to date is £25,500,000.00 (ex. VAT).",,,"United Kingdom","33157000 ","Dan Webster",cco@cabinetoffice.gov.uk,"9th Floor, The Capital Building,","Old Hall Street",Liverpool,"L3 9PP",England,"+44 08009981098",https://www.gov.uk/ccs,"Justification for the choice of the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a call for competition in accordance with Article 32 of Directive 201424EU.pdf ","https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:406004-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML ","Contract 1 - Agreement for the Manufacture and Supply of Ventilators (Smiths ParaPac 300)

The ESN will deliver integrated critical voice and broadband data services to all three emergency services (3ES) and other users throughout GB (England, Wales and Scotland). These services require a mobile communications network capable of providing the full coverage, resilience, security and public safety functionality required by the 3ES. The ESN will replace those services delivered under current service contract(s). A number of these service contracts operate across the 3ES and other users. The new service contracts were awarded during 2015 to facilitate commencement of service delivery from late 2016 as existing service contracts begin to expire. The procurement is divided into 3 Lots with associated Related Projects. \r
\r
This Contract Award Notice is with regard to a Contract awarded to one of the incumbent Suppliers of Control Room systems (as deployed to the UK 3ES customers) to develop a compatible ICCS product upgrade that enables the Supplier's control room ICCS product(s) to interface to ESN. The development is to commence with integration for the minimum subset of Kodiak 9.0, 9.1 and Kodiak 10 features as set out in the Technical Requirements, with a view to subsequently migrating to Kodiak 11 and potentially other future releases as necessary to support the delivery of ESN. \r
\r
The Contract includes the provision of software development services, a proof of concept and testing at a Live End User site, as well as the potential for the provision of ongoing support and maintenance in support of the Supplier's ESN capability. \r

\r
As part of the National Testing Strategy, Pillar 4's surveillance work endeavours to capture a nationwide picture of Covid-19's prevalence amongst the wider UK population.\r
Unlike the other demographic specific studies, the UK Biobank Seroprevalence Study is intended to capture [sero]prevalence data from across the country, both now and over the course of the next 6 months. The data from the study will be sent to DHSC on a weekly basis.\r
DHSC have partnered with the UK Biobank who are project managing the research, given their existing cohort of participants, operational and analytical expertise.\r
UK Biobank aims to collect monthly blood samples and symptom data (via a short questionnaire) from its participants (as well as from their children and grandchildren aged over 18) to enable an assessment of the extent of previous infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 coronavirus (by measuring blood antibodies) in different locations and age groups across the UK.\r
The aim is to recruit a population-based sub-study from UK Biobank participants and their adult (i.e. aged over 18) children and grandchildren. It is expected that participants will contribute to the study for 6 months (extendable). The duration of the study will be determined by the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK.\r
The objective of the study is to determine the extent of previous infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID‐19 (by collecting samples that can be measured for blood antibodies) in a nationally representative sample of the UK population.\r
The UK Biobank funded activities cover participant recruitment, sample collection, sample processing and storage, and provision of samples to the University of Oxford for sample assay to measure blood antibodies and reporting of infection rates based on returned quantitative assay data.\r

In addition to the operating plant, the plant infrastructure includes a workshop, storage facilities and office space. The plant is fully manned 8am - 4pm Mon-Fri, with an out-of-hours emergency on-call roster in operation.  During peak periods, skeleton weekend coverage is sometimes necessary.

The service required under the contract is the operation of and planned & preventative maintenance to the mine water treatment plant including:

Referrals will be accepted from a South Warwickshire GP, optometrist, A&E Department, Eye Casualty or 111. (Triage tool to be agreed with the commissioner.)
The service will comprise of three main tiers, which are covered within the service specification, but can be delivered by multiple organisations with partnership or subcontracting arrangements, or by a single provider for all tiers.
Providers are responsible for coordinating partnership or sub-contracting arrangements between themselves. Service delivery needs to be integrated and seamlessly delivered to patients. Reporting needs to be coordinated and presented centrally as per reporting requirements set out in the NHS standard contract section 6.
The service will have a suitable level of clinical delivery, supervision and leadership, and will be consultant-led. This means a consultant will be accountable for the delivery of the service, available and contactable when necessary and will retain overall responsibility while the service is open.
All new referrals will be triaged by appropriately skilled clinicians (in the view of the lead consultant) who will signpost the patient to the most appropriate service or pathway for treatment. This triage function will also be consultant led and therefore by definition, the consultant will have oversight and be accountable for the safe and accurate delivery of all aspects of the service.
The provider will work to best practice as published nationally, including, but not limited to, the development of schemes set out by NHSE Elective Care Transformation Programme and other guidance published during the contract term:
1.	The development, implementation and management of a standardised cataract referral forms;
2.	The triage of Glaucoma referrals onto the correct care pathway (dependent upon complexity);
3.	Implementation of a patient education programme with supporting patient decision aids;
4.	Liaison and support to upskill community optometrists optimising diagnostic and referral quality.
These service developments will be established and implemented during the course of the contract and will be detailed with applicable timescales within the NHS Standard Contract Particulars Section 6d; Service Development Improvement Plan (SDIP).

•	The events that have led to the need for extreme urgency were unforeseen - the COVID-19 situation is so novel that the consequences are not something that MDC could have predicted.
•	It is impossible to comply with the usual timescales in the Public Contract Regulations (2015) - there is no time to run an accelerated procurement under the open or restricted procedures or competitive procedures with negotiation, nor does the MDC have access to an existing commercial agreement such as a framework or dynamic purchasing system.
The situation is not attributable to the MDC - MDC has not done anything to cause or contribute to the need for extreme urgency.

The Council is on track to deliver 1,850 new affordable homes by 2023 with sites for a further potential 2,000 new homes identified. The delivery of these homes involves complex regeneration schemes at Ebury Bridge Estate and Church Street, as well as sensitive infill and prominent high- profile sites across the city. The delivery of these homes will depend on a range of delivery solutions including partnerships with development and investment partners and self-delivery. The Council&apos;s newly formed wholly owned development company also offers a route for funding, delivering and owning new intermediate rent, market rent and sale housing across the borough.

The Ebury Bridge Estate renewal project is the most strategically important of all these developments. Ebury is located in the South-West of the borough, close to the mainline Victoria Station. Railway tracks to Victoria act as a physical barrier to the East of the estate and the Belgravia neighbourhood is to the West. The estate has excellent connectivity and offers a tremendous opportunity for a prestigious, exemplar estate renewal opportunity in Central London.

The Council has made significant investment over recent years developing a high- quality exciting scheme in consultation with local residents and approved the full demolition and re-provision of the estate in July 2018. The Council has established an experienced team and in March 2019 committed to and approved the self-delivery (Council as Employer) of an initial phase comprising two residential blocks providing over 200 new, mixed tenure homes and the first of the new open public squares, setting the design quality and delivery intentions for the new Ebury. This initial phase will enable the Council to fulfil their re-housing commitments locally and achieve vacant possession of later phases. Ebury sits at the heart of the Council&apos;s City for All intention and we are now seeking suitable partners to help us deliver and achieve these aspirations.

The Council is seeking a suitable and appropriately qualified Design & Build partner to deliver the programme which is currently phased, with phase 1 aiming to start on site at the end of 2020. The estimated construction value of the requirement is currently valued between £97m-350 m (Phase 1 - all phases). All amounts are subject to indexation and the procurement contracts make provision for changes which mean the procurement value may be increased beyond the range included in this notice, changes will be in accordance with regulation 72 of the Public Contract Regulations 2015.

In Phase 1 the Council will be the successful Tenderer&apos;s employer and the Council will self-fund the cost of construction.

The type of equipment provided can range from simple mobility aids, such as crutches and walking frames, to more complex items such as profiling beds and hoists. Items are provided to citizens free of charge, on loan or single issue, in line with agreed criteria.
      
      The Birmingham Community Equipment Loan Service is available to citizens of all ages who meet the criteria for the service, however, the majority of those in receipt of equipment are aged 65+. Approximately 131,300 citizens have been registered with this service.
