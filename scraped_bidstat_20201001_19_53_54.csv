04 Nov 2019,Contracts Finder,Department of Health,PROFESSIONAL,The Fleming Fund Independent Evaluation Supplier,£2M-£2M,1,Itad,"This is notification that the Department is running an Ojeu Open Procurement for the services described. - (for which see ITT ref number 60236).

Interested suppliers need to register on the BMS system if they have not done so already.

Details of registration can be found on the attached instructions document and link provided.

The UK Government has announced the Fleming Fund to support low and middle income countries in tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR) through addressing the gaps with good quality assured data and surveillance.

Drug-resistant infections could kill an extra 10 million people across the world every year by 2050 if they are not tackled.

They could also cost the world around $100 trillion in lost output: more than the size of the current world economy (Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, 2014).

Both the Prime Minister and Chief Medical Officer have announced that tackling AMR at home and abroad is a key priority and that the UK will help to lead a global response in this field.

To facilitate this, the Department of Health (DH) is working closely with the Department for International Development (DFID) to establish programmes aimed at supporting low and middle income countries, where there remains very little data on the extent of the problem or what priority actions should be taken.

Description of the procurement:The requirement is for an Independent evaluation supplier to deliver an independent long-term performance evaluation of whether the Fleming Fund has achieved its outcomes and impacts, providing formative recommendations to improve implementation, and a summary of its effects based upon initial evidence.

The contract will include break clause timings as described in the Procurement Documentation.

It is expected that the evaluation supplier will have the capacity to work over a 5 year period or longer, conducting evaluations in different countries across the world simultaneously, if necessary.

It will be a requirement of the evaluation supplier to work closely with the management agent of the Fleming Fund during the inception phase to decide how to co-operate in the collection and sharing of compliance data and monitoring of the projects, while remaining independent, shown in an agreed governance structure.

This data will allow the evaluator to make formative recommendations at timely points throughout the life of the programme and inform the answering of set summative evaluation questions.

We would look for the evaluation supplier to propose a methodology on how they will conduct the evaluation, any additional products they feel would be appropriate to produce and demonstrated to work through contextual political issues.

Bidders are required to refer to the procurement documentation for full details of the requirement.

The Contract is expected to be for a period of up to 60 months, with extension options.

See attached Procurement documents.

In May 2020 the Council was informed by Places Leisure that it could not viably maintain the facilities and was seeking to exit from the arrangement. This announcement triggered an urgent and immediate need to seek an alternative provider to manage the transition of the facilities.

The Council has appointed Sports and Leisure Management Ltd (Everyone Active) as operator of River Park Centre and Meadowside Leisure Centre under Regulation 32 (2) (c) of the Public Contract Regulations 2015. Given the current public health crisis, it was imperative that an urgent award was placed to ensure a smooth transition to the new provider and allow them time to implement the appropriate safety measures (in line with Government guidance)."

In order to do this, the current network consists of 155 remote radio sites (RRS), situated around 11 000 miles of UK coastline. This network facilitates all communication transmissions to and from vessels at sea and to the HM Coastguard Watch Officers based at our 10 coastguard operation centres around the UK and the National Maritime Operations centre in Fareham via two data centres.

The existing network that links these remote radio sites to the HMCG operations centres needed to be replaced; the reason is that the analogue Kilostream product that underpins the existing network has been withdrawn from the market in March 2020 by BT in line with a wider OFCOM deregulation of low bandwidth analogue point-to-point product types across the telecommunications industry."

The Partnership is seeking to jointly commission evidence-based services that support children on the edge of care, and in care, to achieve better social outcomes. We believe that there is a strong evidence base demonstrating that children and young people achieve better outcomes when they are able to remain in a family environment. Through these services we collectively aim to support young people to achieve stable placements in the family setting, and where possible to remain at home with their families.

We are seeking a service provider or consortia of service providers to deliver three distinct interventions across all three local authorities:

Edge of care: an intensive family intervention to support children and young people on the edge of care remain safely with their families. A young person on the edge of care is someone:

• who is not currently a looked after child (LAC) but who is identified as being at high risk of becoming LAC within the next 12 months; or

• who is currently a LAC who we are seeking to re-unify with their family.

Placement support: specialist provision to help young people who have entered residential care to step down to foster care, or specialist provision for those in foster care and at a high risk of entering residential care to remain in foster care."

for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy).

The definition of fuel poverty relates to households with required fuel bills which are higher than average, and payment of those bills would mean that householders are living below the official poverty line.

The value of the contract is subject to change.

Grant funding arrangements for all installation works and repair services are only agreed each financial year for the following 12-month period (April to March).

Funding can therefore reduce or indeed be terminated (as per terms and conditions) if the budget becomes unavailable.

The current funding value is only guaranteed until the end of March 2021.

• Information, advice, guidance and training services shall be available to all residents in Coventry, but with a focus on those who are more likely to be living in fuel poverty, or more likely to experience the negative health impacts of living in a cold home.

• Heating and insulation measures shall be targeted at those most vulnerable and will include the requirement for individuals to be dependent on benefits or on low incomes and have a health condition and/or disability that is exacerbated by living in a cold home.

• Interventions shall run alongside and include other winter campaigns e.g. seasonal flu vaccination and exploit other opportunities for partnership working.

Services shall support other council initiatives as appropriate, including those aligned to the Health and Wellbeing Strategy.

• The Provider, with approval and support from Coventry City Council commissioners, shall seek and apply for external funding/grant opportunities to support the Keeping Coventry Warm service objectives.

• Interventions shall be complementary to the existing work of the City Council and any national schemes, e.g. Housing Health and Safety Rating System powers with regard to excess cold, and the Energy Company Obligation (ECO/ECO Flex), and other local and national initiatives.

In particular, the Provider shall supplement and complement the Keeping Coventry Warm Service by enabling households to have ECO funded insulation or heating work carried out.

The provider will manage an ECO service in parallel with the Keeping Coventry Warm Service, and will work with obligated suppliers, intermediary organisations and contractors to optimise the amount and types of assistance available to qualifying households.

The Provider will be required to maintain a panel of suitable subcontractors to carry out insulation and heating work.

The Provider will exercise all due care and diligence in the selection, appointment and management of the subcontractors, commensurate with best practice and in accordance with all applicable law and regulation."
