The study (which is funded by the Department of Health and Social Care) aims to collect blood samples from study participants each month for an initial period of 6 months and measure these samples to assess the extent of previous infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 coronavirus (by measuring blood antibodies) in different locations and age groups across the UK. In order to enable the study, UK Biobank needed a supplier to provide an assay which could be used to measure blood antibodies. There was an urgent need to identify a supplier of an assay to enable UK Biobank to design the study – in particular the method of blood collection – to enable the study to start without delay. The study needed to start as soon as possible to enable UK Biobank to report the assay results to DHSC to assist the DHSC in its monitoring of Covid-19 in the population as part of its urgent public health response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
