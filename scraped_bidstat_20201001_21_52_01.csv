The Partnership is seeking to jointly commission evidence-based services that support children on the edge of care, and in care, to achieve better social outcomes. We believe that there is a strong evidence base demonstrating that children and young people achieve better outcomes when they are able to remain in a family environment. Through these services we collectively aim to support young people to achieve stable placements in the family setting, and where possible to remain at home with their families.

We are seeking a service provider or consortia of service providers to deliver three distinct interventions across all three local authorities:

Edge of care: an intensive family intervention to support children and young people on the edge of care remain safely with their families. A young person on the edge of care is someone:

• who is not currently a looked after child (LAC) but who is identified as being at high risk of becoming LAC within the next 12 months; or

• who is currently a LAC who we are seeking to re-unify with their family.

Placement support: specialist provision to help young people who have entered residential care to step down to foster care, or specialist provision for those in foster care and at a high risk of entering residential care to remain in foster care."

30 Sep 2020,Contracts Finder,Coventry Solihull Warwickshire,INDUSTRIAL,COV - Affordable Warmth Services - Keeping Coventry Warm - AWARD,£0-£2M,1,Act on Energy,"In 2018, there were 16,512 (12.1%) households estimated to be living in fuel poverty in Coventry (latest national statistical release from the Dept.

for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy).

The definition of fuel poverty relates to households with required fuel bills which are higher than average, and payment of those bills would mean that householders are living below the official poverty line.

The value of the contract is subject to change.

Grant funding arrangements for all installation works and repair services are only agreed each financial year for the following 12-month period (April to March).

Funding can therefore reduce or indeed be terminated (as per terms and conditions) if the budget becomes unavailable.

The current funding value is only guaranteed until the end of March 2021.

• Information, advice, guidance and training services shall be available to all residents in Coventry, but with a focus on those who are more likely to be living in fuel poverty, or more likely to experience the negative health impacts of living in a cold home.

• Heating and insulation measures shall be targeted at those most vulnerable and will include the requirement for individuals to be dependent on benefits or on low incomes and have a health condition and/or disability that is exacerbated by living in a cold home.

• Interventions shall run alongside and include other winter campaigns e.g. seasonal flu vaccination and exploit other opportunities for partnership working.

Services shall support other council initiatives as appropriate, including those aligned to the Health and Wellbeing Strategy.

• The Provider, with approval and support from Coventry City Council commissioners, shall seek and apply for external funding/grant opportunities to support the Keeping Coventry Warm service objectives.

• Interventions shall be complementary to the existing work of the City Council and any national schemes, e.g. Housing Health and Safety Rating System powers with regard to excess cold, and the Energy Company Obligation (ECO/ECO Flex), and other local and national initiatives.

In particular, the Provider shall supplement and complement the Keeping Coventry Warm Service by enabling households to have ECO funded insulation or heating work carried out.

The provider will manage an ECO service in parallel with the Keeping Coventry Warm Service, and will work with obligated suppliers, intermediary organisations and contractors to optimise the amount and types of assistance available to qualifying households.

The Provider will be required to maintain a panel of suitable subcontractors to carry out insulation and heating work.

The Provider will exercise all due care and diligence in the selection, appointment and management of the subcontractors, commensurate with best practice and in accordance with all applicable law and regulation."
